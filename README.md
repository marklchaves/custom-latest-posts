# custom-latest-posts

Custom Gutenberg Block (CGB) for displaying latest posts using [Lazy Blocks](https://lazyblocks.com/) plugin.

After trying the following methods for creating a CGB:

1. From scratch
2. Using [Create Guten Block](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block) framework
3. Using [Block Lab](https://getblocklab.com/) plugin
4. Using Lazy Blocks plugin

I've decided to run with Lazy Blocks. This is the repo for my CGB using Lazy Blocks.
