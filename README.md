# custom-latest-posts using Block Lab

Custom Gutenberg Block (CGB) for displaying latest posts using [Block Lab](https://getblocklab.com/) plugin.

After trying the following methods for creating a CGB:

1. From scratch
2. Using [Create Guten Block](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block) framework
3. Using [Block Lab](https://getblocklab.com/) plugin
4. Using [Lazy Blocks](https://lazyblocks.com/) plugin

I've decided to run with **Lazy Blocks**. This repo is for documenting the work I've done using **Block Lab**.
