# custom-latest-posts

Custom Gutenberg Block (CGB) for displaying latest posts using [Lazy Blocks](https://lazyblocks.com/) plugin.

After trying the following methods of creating a CGB:

1. From scratch
2. Using Create Guten Block framework
3. Using Block Lab plugin
4. Using Lazy Blocks plugin

I've decided to run with Lazy Blocks. This is the repo for my CGB using Lazy Blocks.
